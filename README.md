# Weather Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

# Motivation :
 Accurate temperature forecasting is essential for various sectors like agriculture, energy, and disaster management.Reliable predictions help communities prepare for extreme weather events, reducing potential damage.Insights from historical temperature patterns can improve planning in transportation and logistics.Studying temperature trends supports environmental research and climate change monitoring.


# Objectives :
 Develop a time-series model to forecast average daily temperature accurately. Analyze historical temperature data to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonality.Evaluate the performance of forecasting models using metrics like RMSE.Compare traditional methods (ARIMA) with advanced approaches (Prophet).


# Data Description :

The DataSet is taken from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jarvis11/manual-daily-temperature

It consist of 1825 data points and 6 columns.
